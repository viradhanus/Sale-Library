### Problem we trying to solve with this project
When we buy books for ourselves to use, after some years they become not nessasary for us. Most of the times we sell them to shops as paper or waste material. But there still can be people who would buy,lend these books from you for their usage. So it is a waste of resourses if you discard or keep them without using at home.
<br/><br/>
After we finish school,university studies most of the subject based books become not much of use to us. Also novels and other entertaining books we tend to not read twice. So most of us have the need to give away these books to readers who takes the most out of it.
<br/><br/>
In the current library systems do not have an online or a web based system to find readers who are willing to exchange or sell books which they are not using. Sometimes it is also not possible to donate used books to libraries due to certain policies. Also public libraries are limited to cities and might not have the books we need for our purpose or already lended to someone else. So it becomes difficult to find the books and waste of  time finding it.
<br/><br/>
Moreover, if a person can get an overview of the books available and get a discussion with the readers community over some online platform he/she can decide the most suitable book  for the need. If we can create a online data base system with a forum facility it can be a very useful web base books exchange/sell  discussion platform for readers around the country.
<br/><br/>
So with these issues a method of an online system, where personal books owners and buyers find eachother to exchange used books can be very useful.
<br/><br/>
### Solution
Our solution for the above problem is a website that Contains details about used books/magazines people are willing to sell or exchange. Users can access to this website to get information about them. 
<br/><br/>
They can access to the website as an outsider or login using a username. Users can scroll through the website and find descriptions about currently available books/magazines. Only registered users will have access to publish their own books into  the website with details and post articles to the forum.
<br/><br/>
Details that need to include by the publisher, first_name, last_name, ISBN, book_title ,contact_number,address etc.
<br/><br/>
### How to use
* To get the maximum advantage of the site, users have to login. If you are a new user, you have to create an account first.
* When creating a new account, the first user needs to provide username and a valid email address.
* Then the user is asked to verify the provided email address. **(NOTE: The verification email may be received to the spam folder. Make sure to check it there.)**
* After successfully verifying the account, the user is asked to set a password. Then user can log in to the account anytime using any browser using those credentials.
* All the details regarding posting an ad, have been included in **[Help & Contact](https://dev-sale-library.pantheonsite.io/help-contact)** section.

### Technical Overview 
The website is build mainly using Drupal 7, which is powered with ‘PHP’.  Apache is used as the web server. MySQL is used as the database server. 
</br>
We used pantheon as the web hosting service which is free at the development stage and allows us to develop the site as a team.
